# US Medical Insurance Costs
In this Codecadmey project I am investigating a medical insurance costs [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) using Python. 

## Goals:
- Find the average age of patients in the dataset.
- Analyze where the majority of the individuals are from.
- Look at the different costs between smoker vs. non-smokers.
- Figure out what the average age is for someone who has atleast one child in this dataset.

> What will I find?
